# 1. System Design

## 1.1. Computer Architecture

![](img/computer-light.excalidraw.svg#only-light){ width="300" }
![](img/computer-dark.excalidraw.svg#only-dark){ width="300" }

Computers use **bits** (0 or 1) to represent data and commands

- `bit` - 0 or 1
- `byte` - 8 bits
- `KB` - 1024 bytes
- `MB` - 1024 KBs
- `GB` - 1024 MBs
- `TB` - 1024 GBs
- *etc...*

### 1.1.1. Storage

Arranged from **slowest to fastest** and **largest to smallest** possible size:

- `HDD` | `SSD` - **Non-volatile** (retains data without power)
- `RAM` - **Volatile** (loses data without power)
- `Cache` - Order of CPU looking for data in cache (L1 -> L2 -> L3 -> RAM)

### 1.1.2. CPU

!!! tip "CPU Functions"
    - **Fetches**, **decodes**, and **executes** instructions
    - Can read/write from RAM/Disk/Cache data

!!! warning "Memory Access"
    CPU accesses memory in this order:
    
    1. L1 Cache
    2. L2 Cache
    3. L3 Cache
    4. RAM
    
    :zap: *Faster access, but smaller capacity as you go up the list*
## 1.2. **High-level Architecture of a Production App**

![Stream flow](img/app-architecture-light.excalidraw.svg#only-light)
![Stream flow](img/app-architecture-dark.excalidraw.svg#only-dark)

!!! info
    - **`CI/CD`** - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment  
    - **`Load Balancer`** - Ensures user requests are evenly distributed between servers  
        :white_check_mark: Example: **Nginx**  
    - **`Logging & Monitoring`** - Standard practice is to store logs on a separate server from the production server  
        :white_check_mark: Examples: **DataDog, Sentry, Prometheus**  
    - **`Alert Server`** - Accumulates and sends out issue updates, either to users or developer Slack chats, to inform about issues.

---

### 1.2.1. **Investigation Process**
:mag: Once developers are informed of an issue, follow these steps to investigate
    
1. **Identify** the issue in the logs  
2. Use **Pipelines** to deploy to a safe environment and **replicate** the issue  
    :warning: Never use **production** for this  
3. **Release a quick patch** to get things working again

---

## 1.3. **Good Design Requirements**
- **`Scalability`** - System should grow with its user base  
- **`Maintainability`** - Ensure ease of future development and improvements  
- **`Efficiency`** - Optimal use of resources  
- **`Reliability`** - System remains stable when things go wrong

---

### 1.3.1. **3 Key Elements of System Design**

!!! info ":gear: **Moving Data**"
    - Ensure data flows seamlessly between components (user, system, databases)  
    - **Optimized for speed and security**

!!! info ":floppy_disk: **Storing Data**"
    - Consider **Access patterns, Indexing strategies, Backup solutions**  
    - Data should be **readily available** and **stored securely**

!!! info ":arrows_clockwise: **Transforming Data**"
    - Convert raw data into meaningful information  
    - Aggregate log files for analysis  
    - Convert user input into different formats


### 1.3.2. CAP Theorem A.K.A Brewer's Theorem

Assumes distributed system

![](img/cap-light.excalidraw.svg#only-light){width=400}
![](img/cap-dark.excalidraw.svg#only-dark){width=400}

- `Consistency` - Ensures all nodes in the distributed system have the same data at the same time. Change in one node should also be reflected in all nodes.
    - Strong Consistency: All read and writes operations are guaranteed to be immediately consistent with each other, regardless of network delays or failures
- `Availability` - System is always operational and responsive to requests regardless of partial node failure
    - High Availability: The system remains operational and responds to requests even in presetns of network or other system issues.
- `Partition Tolerance` - Systems ability to continue functioning even if a network partition occur
    - Partition Tolerance: The system continues to operate, even when network communications between nodes is unreliable or fails.

Can only achieve 2 out of those properties at the same time

!!! note "Can only achieve 2 out of those properties at the same time"
    
    - `CA` - Prioritises both consistency and availability. They do not tolerate network partitions an always aim for strong consistency.
        - RDBMS
    - `AP` - Prioritise availability and partitioning tolerance over strict consistency. They systems may provide eventual consistency, where data may take some time to propagate and become consistent across all nodes.
        - Cassandra, DynamoDB
    - `CP` - Consistency is prioritised, even at the expense of availability. When network partition occurs, the system might choose to become temporary unavailable rather than risk delivering inconsistent data
        - MongoDB, HBase, Redis

Not about finding the perfect solution, it's about finding the best solution for our specific use case

### 1.3.3. Availability

Usually measured as 99.999%

!!! example "Example"
    Running service with 99.9% availability, allows for 8.76 hour of downtime a year
    `365*24 * 0.001 = 8.76 Hours`

    99.999% only allows 5 mins of downtime a year
    
 
!!! note "SLO-Service Level Objectives"
    Example. Can set that our service should respond to the request within 300ms  99.9% of the time

!!! note "SLA-Service Level Agreements"
    More like format contracts with the users. They define a minimum level of service we're committing to provide. If your availability drops below our stated availability in the SLA, we might have to provide refunds.

### 1.3.4. Assessing System Resilience

We use the following criteria to assess system resilience:

- :shield: `Reliability`
    - Ensuring system works **correctly** and **consistently**
- :collision: `Fault Tolerance`
    - How does system handle **unexpected failures** or **attacks**
- :repeat: `Redundancy`
    - Having a system **backup** that takes over when part of the system fails
- :zap: `Speed`
    - `Throughput` - How much data our system can handle over a certain period of time
        - Server Throughput is measured in `RPS` (requests per second)
        - DB Throughput is measured in `QPS` (Queries per second)
        - Data throughput measured in `B/s` (Bytes per second)
    - `Latency` - How long it takes to handle a single request

!!! danger "Speed Optimization Trade-off"
    When it comes to optimising speed, it often affects other metrics. For example, increasing throughput by batching jobs will decrease latency.

## 1.4. :globe_with_meridians: 1.4. Networking Basics

!!! info "IP Addresses"
    - `IP Address` - unique identifier
        - `IPv4` - **32-bit** -> 4B addresses
        - `IPv6` - **128-bit** -> 340T addresses

### API Best Practices

!!! tip "Security Measures"
    # 1. Rate Limiter :shield:
    - **Purpose:** Prevents DDOS attacks and excessive API usage
    - **Implementation:**
        - Set request limits per user/IP
        - `429 Too Many Requests` response when exceeded
        - Helps maintain API stability

    # 2. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) :globe_with_meridians:
    - **Purpose:** Controls domain access to API
    - **Implementation:**
        - Define allowed origins
        - Set appropriate headers
        - Prevents unauthorized cross-site interactions

## 💾 Caching and CDN

!!! info "Caching Overview :gear:"
    **Purpose:** Improves system performance and efficiency
    *Involves storing temporary data copies in cache*

### 🔄 Common Caching Locations

!!! tip "1. Browser Caching :globe_with_meridians:"
    - **Local Storage:**
        - Stores data locally instead of server requests
        - :wrench: Configurable via browser developer tools
    
    **Header Controls:**
    - `max-age`
    - `stale-if-error`
    - `stale-while-revalidate`

    **Metrics:**
    $Cache Ratio = Cache Hits \div (Cache Hits + Cache Misses)$


!!! tip "2. Server Caching"
    - **Storage Options:**
        - Server-side storage
        - Separate cache servers
        - In-memory (Redis) or disk storage

    **Caching Strategies:**
    
    1. **Write-around:**
        - :fast_forward: Direct storage writing
        - *Best for cases where data freshness is very important*
    
    2. **Write-through:**
        - :arrows_counterclockwise: Simultaneous cache/storage updates
        - *Ensures data consistency*
        - *Can be slower that write-around*
    
    3. **Write-back:**
        - :rocket: Cache-first approach, then to permanent storage
        - :warning: Risk of data loss during crashes

    **Eviction Policies:**
    
    - `LRU` (Least Recently Used)
    - `FIFO` (First In First Out)
    - `LFU` (Least Frequently Used)

!!! tip "3. Database Caching"
    - **Implementation:**
        - Internal database system
        - External cache layer (Redis/Memcache)
    
    **Process Flow:**
    
    1. Check cache first
    2. Return cached data if present
    3. Execute query if cache miss
    4. Store new results in cache

    :bulb: *Optimal for read-heavy applications*
    
    Same eviction policies as above

!!! tip "4. CDN (Content Delivery Networks) :earth_americas:"
    **Purpose:** Distributed server network for static content delivery
    
    When a user requests a resource, the request is redirected to the nearest CDN server, if the CND server has the cached content it delivers it, if not it fetches and caches it from the origin server and delivers to the user
    
    **Content Types:**
    
    - JavaScript
    - HTML/CSS
    - Images/Videos

    **Distribution Strategies:**
    
    1. **Pull-based:**
        - :arrow_down: Automatic content pulling
        - *Ideal for frequently updated static content*
        - Self-managing updates
    
    2. **Push-based:**
        - :arrow_up: Manual content distribution
        - *Best for large, infrequently updated files*
        - Requires active management
    
    **Control:**
    
    - `Cache-Control` header defines cache duration
