`Rationalist` - approach involves a combination of mathematics and engineering

### Acting Humanly: The Turing Test approach

> The computer passes 'Turing Test' if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer

The computer would need to posses the following capabilities:

-   **Natural Language Processing** - to enable communication in English
-   **Knowledge Representation** - to store what it knows or hears
-   **Automated Reasoning** - to answer questions or draw new conclusions
-   **Machine Learning** - to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

> For the 'Total Turing Test', there would also be a video signal for the interrogator to test perceptual abilities, with the objects passed through the hatch

-   **Computer vision** - to perceive objects
-   **Robotics** - to manipulate objects and move about.

### Thinking Humanly: The Cognitive Modelling approach

A way of imitating human thought process by the computer with the help of cognitive science.

### Thinking Rationally: The "Laws of Thought" approach

Using formal logical notations and formal to reason about problems and solve them .“Socrates is a man; all men are mortal; therefore, Socrates is mortal.”

### Acting Rationally: The Rational Agent approach

`Agent` - something that acts

`Rational Agent` - one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.

## The Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

### Philosophy

-   Can formal rules be use to draw valid conclusions ?
-   How does the mind arise from a physical brain ?
-   Where does knowledge come from ?
-   How does knowledge lead to action ?

### Mathematics

-   What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions ?
-   What can be computed ?
-   How do we reason with uncertain information ?

Three fundamental ares:

-   Logic
-   Computation
-   Probability

### Economics

-   How should we make decisions so as to maximise payoff ?
-   How should we do this when others may not go along ?
-   How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future ?

### Neuroscience

-   How do brains process information ?

### Psychology

-   How do humans and animals think and act ?

### Computer Engineering

-   How can we build an efficient computer ?

### Control Theory and Cybernetics

-   How can artefacts operate under their own control ?

### Linguistics

-   How does language relate to thought ?
