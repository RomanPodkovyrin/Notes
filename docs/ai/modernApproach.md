## 3.1. What is AI ?

|                                  | Measure success in terms of fidelity to `human performance`  | Measure against ideal performance measure `rationality`      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Though process` and `reasoning` | **Thinking Humanly** <br> "The exciting new effort to make computers think ... machines with minds, in the full and literal sense"<br>"The automation of activities that we associate with human thinking" | **Thinking Rationally**<br>"The study of the computational models"<br>"The study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason and act" |
| `Behaviour`                      | **Acting Humanly**<br>"The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people"<br>"The study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better" | **Acting Rationally**<br>"Computational Intelligence is the study of the design of intelligent agents"<br>"AI ... is concerned with intelligent behaviour in artefacts" |

`Rationalist` - approach involves a combination of mathematics and engineering

### 3.1.1. Acting Humanly: The Turing Test approach

> The computer passes 'Turing Test' if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer

The computer would need to posses the following capabilities:

- **Natural Language Processing** - to enable communication in English
- **Knowledge Representation** - to store what it knows or hears
- **Automated Reasoning** - to answer questions or draw new conclusions
- **Machine Learning** - to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

> For the 'Total Turing Test', there would also be a video signal  for the interrogator to test perceptual abilities, with the objects passed through the hatch

- **Computer vision** - to perceive objects
- **Robotics** - to manipulate objects and move about. 

### 3.1.2. Thinking Humanly: The Cognitive Modelling approach 

A way of imitating human thought process by the computer with the help of cognitive science. 

### 3.1.3. Thinking Rationally: The "Laws of Thought" approach

Using formal logical notations and formal to reason about problems and solve them .“Socrates is a man; all men are mortal; therefore, Socrates is mortal.”

### 3.1.4. Acting Rationally: The Rational Agent approach

`Agent` - something that acts

`Rational Agent` - one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.

## 3.2. The Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

### 3.2.1. Philosophy

- Can formal rules be use to draw valid conclusions ?
- How does the mind arise from a physical brain ?
- Where does knowledge come from ?
- How does knowledge lead to action ?

### 3.2.2. Mathematics

- What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions ?
- What can be computed ?
- How do we reason with uncertain information ?



Three fundamental ares:

- Logic
- Computation
- Probability

### 3.2.3. Economics

- How should we make decisions so as to maximise payoff ?
- How should we do this when others may not go along ?
- How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future ?

### 3.2.4. Neuroscience

- How do brains process information ?

### 3.2.5. Psychology

- How do humans and animals think and act ?

### 3.2.6. Computer Engineering

- How can we build an efficient computer ?

### 3.2.7. Control Theory and Cybernetics

- How can artefacts operate under their own control ?

### 3.2.8. Linguistics

- How does language relate to thought ?
